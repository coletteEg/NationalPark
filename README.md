Welcome! Hello friends this is my awesome project. I wanted to create something that would focus on my love for National Parks. I have great dreams about traveling to every National Park in the United States with my little family. Working on this project has deepend my love for the parks and I hope to continue working on this and making it a really helpful website for my travels.

On the bucket page you are able to add parks to your list, delete them, and cross them off (as if youve visited them).
